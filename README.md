# OpenCVSharpTesting

Repository with test programs for the use of OpenCVSharp binding of OpenCV.
These are typical test programs when starting in OpenCV.
At the time I didn't see examples of OpenCV applications using VB.NET and that was the language of choice at my place of work.
I thought they may be of some use to others finding themselves in simlar circumstances.
